                    Hi guys! Weâ€™re Alli and Justin two young adults from Colorado taking a sabatical in 2024 to travel around the world. 
                    We left our software engineering jobs in January 2023 with 45k in savings and a plan to travel for the next year.

                    We hope to use this blog to document our travels and share with you all the places we visit. 
                    <i>Hopefully we can inspire you to take a trip of your own!</i>

                </p>
